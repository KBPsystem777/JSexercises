## [Unreleased]

## [1.3.0] - 2018-06-20

1.3.0 introduces a brief clean up of our CSS, overall site typography and some improvements to Algolia search.

Welcome to our newest user, [ml5](https://ml5js.org/), a really cool machine library in JavaScript.

Thank you to the following contributors who helped with this release:

- @endiliey
- @JoelMarcey
- @yangshun

### Breaking changes

- Since we made some CSS changes, there's a good chance it might not be compatible with your custom CSS if you have any. We recommend that you audit each page of the site for any UI issues caused by this change. We'll try to minimize such backward-incompatible CSS changes in future.
- Other UI changes include:
  - Left sidebar is sticky by default on supported browsers. We saw many of our users write custom CSS for that behavior and decided to incorporate it in the core.
  - Footer is now a darker shade of black for better contrast.
  - Background color of site changed to `#fff`.
  - Headers are now black (from `$primaryColor`) and have bolder font weight.
  - Blockquotes are changed to yellow (from pink).

### Fixed/Changed

- The search input will now search the docs in the [correct language](https://github.com/facebook/Docusaurus/commit/df429262429e449e78745423ff2c9ab6c6fd1d5c).
- Algolia will be able to scrap emulti-language and/or versioned sites better with the introduction of [special meta tags](https://github.com/facebook/Docusaurus/commit/0eb6612b58a6ee93d5de715f87201eb9fabc82c2).

## [1.2.1] - 2018-06-17

Fixes from existing issues and those found in the 1.2.0 release. Fixes include being able to modify the metadata of a doc without resorting to deleting `en.json`, using absolute URLs instead of relative for docs links, and more. We also added a few new things as well.

### Breaking changes

- This may not affect many users, but if you modified the `en.json` to add your own custom translation strings, we [changed](https://github.com/facebook/Docusaurus/commit/608e2c85a21cd17d9f45496a479ec82f5620a48a) how this is handled, and you will need to [follow the instructions here](https://docusaurus.io/docs/en/translation#custom-translation-strings) to modify your setup.

### Added

- Option to [disable](https://github.com/facebook/Docusaurus/commit/62a2c7c1a599ccaf04a86e9ca2ec0fbca5220f5c) live reload during development.
- Configuration options for [changing](https://github.com/facebook/Docusaurus/commit/58fba70dead064e8c6910e07d3523a548258022f) the title of the blog sidebar info.
- Better support and [documentation](https://docusaurus.io/docs/en/publishing#using-github-pages) for [cross-repo publishing](https://github.com/facebook/Docusaurus/commit/fd9a3ffb6deca84b41dc5a3b43b0db1ca4f3143e).

### Fixed/Changed

- 1.2.0 introduced a bug where you could not update documentation metadata without deleting `en.json`. This has been [fixed](https://github.com/facebook/Docusaurus/commit/608e2c85a21cd17d9f45496a479ec82f5620a48a) as part of the custom translation string breaking change.
- Absolute URLs are now [used](https://github.com/facebook/Docusaurus/commit/0f01eace8be1be273a63089a14d1e3ea2d2cae57) instead of relative URLs for documentation linking to avoid trailing slash issues.
- If you have had trouble updating Docusaurus, it may have been your [Babel cache](https://docusaurus.io/docs/en/installation#updating-your-docusaurus-version).
- No more errors if heading anchors are [empty](https://github.com/facebook/Docusaurus/commit/371fdda4a8c82b5f29dd5c2dd9f04c8ef28dd025).
- Fixed bug when [renaming version](https://github.com/facebook/Docusaurus/commit/a2b076bdcaf7099e595f2f106b38dd0cabeee1ef) where `sidebars.json` were not getting updated.
- Table of contents are now [hidden](https://github.com/facebook/Docusaurus/commit/7bef1b96dc8de8c42795b0983195f66a7ae78c27) when `onPageNav` is not separate.

### Removed

N/A

## [1.1.5] - 2018-05-26

Hotfix. A package in `devDependencies` needed to be moved to `dependencies`.

## [1.1.4] - 2018-05-25

Yet another hotfix release. We found an issue with the way we did LiveReload - we were watching the `node_modules` directory and that caused some users to encounter errors. We stopped watching `node_modules` directory in `gaze`.

Thank you to the following contributors who helped with this release:

- @artiebits
- @yangshun

### Fixed/Changed

- If you already have a tab with the Docusaurus website open, restarting the server will [not open a new browser tab](https://github.com/facebook/Docusaurus/commit/407636a4d92b23fe59c31bbc58a0e3416d91f01f).
- Updated [directory tree display](https://github.com/facebook/Docusaurus/commit/454e3d359f786069f83a5bfe2687e304f1f0547f) for a newly-generated site.
- [Don't watch `node_modules`](https://github.com/facebook/Docusaurus/commit/b5fd7bae738ac14d702e80bd3764fee94e0a8e93) in dev server mode.

## [1.1.3] - 2018-05-23

`npm` had an issue where some packages were not being published. This should hopefully be resolved now; publishing a new version just in case.

Also, welcome [TextLint](https://textlint.github.io/) and [Open Power Quality](https://openpowerquality.org/) as new [users](https://docusaurus.io/en/users.html).

## [1.1.2] - 2018-05-21

Another HOTFIX release. One of our third-party dependencies, `tree-node-cli` didn't support Node 10+. The package has been fixed and we have updated to use the new version of that package.

## [1.1.1] - 2018-05-21

HOTFIX release. Dependency bug found.

### Fixed/Changed

- `opn` needs to be [installed](https://github.com/facebook/Docusaurus/commit/923356e312687cae107db2ec36aaf52f7f03028a), not just in dev dependencies.

## [1.1.0] - 2018-05-20

This is our first major point release. There are three primary reasons for this:

- One of our most requested issues has been implemented - [Live Reload](https://github.com/facebook/Docusaurus/commit/f9a09072e35e274cf4c13b67d228ece3b7722d47).
- We [migrated](https://github.com/facebook/Docusaurus/commit/25cf8bb786abf835e4275e2a9975b33bd5fb2b18) to React 16 support (which wasn't as difficult as initially thought :) )
- The blog now allows for [Facebook-based comments](https://github.com/facebook/Docusaurus/commit/aae106c018667a3787726f7744ce14ccb2b68ef1).

There are a lot of other fixes and enhancements as well. Also, we have five new [users](https://docusaurus.io/en/users.html) of Docusaurus within this release as well. Thank you to [WarriorJS](https://warrior.js.org/), [Bemuse](https://bemuse.ninja/project/), [Pyre-Check](https://pyre-check.org/), [Draft.js](https://draftjs.org/) and [CaptainDuckDuck](https://captainduckduck.com/) for using Docusaurus.

## [1.0.4] - 2017-12-27

This is generally a bug fix release, with some code refactoring. Total commits in this release is 58.

### Breaking Changes

- ***Most users may not run into this problem, but we think it can technically be a breaking change***. PR #322 (original PR #316) and friends changes the way we check for the existence of translations and versioning. Part of that is that we allow for the possibility of an empty language prop, instead of defaulting everything to English. When running 1.0.4, check to make sure your `index.js` works as expected. See [this comment](https://github.com/facebook/Docusaurus/pull/322#issuecomment-352914064) and those below for discussion on this. There is still a bit more work to be done (refactoring and maybe adding a `defaultLang` config option) to make this as clean as possible.

### Added

- `lang` property added on `html` tag, if a language exists and is set (PR #295).
- Added the `wrapPagesHTML` configuration option (PR #332).
- Some adming docs on how to debug with VSCode (PR #335).
- Added docs for the `useEnglishURL` configuration option.

### Fixed/Changed

- Links on landing page in `docusaurus-init` test site do not 404 any longer.
- Refactoring how we check for translations and versioning (PRs #322/#316 and friends).
- Refactored the example `index.js` page (PR #293).
- Link errors, typos and grammatical errors in the docusuarus.io documentation.
